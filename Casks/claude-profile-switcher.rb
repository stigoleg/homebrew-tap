# This file is the template for the tap repo — copy it to
# stigoleg/homebrew-tap as Casks/claude-profile-switcher.rb. After that, the
# release workflow's `update-cask` job keeps `version` and `sha256` current on
# every tagged release (requires the TAP_GITHUB_TOKEN secret; see
# .github/workflows/release.yml).

  caveats <<~EOS
    This app is ad-hoc signed (no Apple Developer ID), so macOS Gatekeeper
    blocks the first launch. After installing, either right-click the app in
    Finder and choose Open (once), or run:
      xattr -d com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/Claude Profile Switcher.app"

    Only do this for software you trust — you can verify downloads against
    the SHA256SUMS file attached to each GitHub release.
